## Matching + Mastering = ❤️

> ### *Loved Matchering?*
> 
> *Check out [**.masterknecht** - free WebAssembly reference mastering tool](https://masterknecht.klangknecht.com/) by [Benjamin Rosseaux](https://www.rosseaux.net/)!*
> 
> *Massive props! 🚀*
>
> *Note: [**.masterknecht**](https://masterknecht.klangknecht.com/) is not related to Matchering's source code at all. It's a completely separate tool written in C and compiled to WebAssembly, which processes all audio locally in your browser without the need for any servers!*

> *— Sergree*

**[Matchering 2.0]** is a novel **[Containerized Web Application](#docker-image)**, **[Python Library][PyPI]**, and **[ComfyUI Node](#comfyui-node)** for audio matching and [mastering].

🔥 Also integrated in the **[UVR5 Desktop App](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/)**!

It follows a *simple idea* - you take TWO audio files and feed them into **Matchering**: 
- **TARGET** (the track you want to master, you want it to sound like the reference)
- **REFERENCE** (another track, like some kind of "wet" popular song, you want your target to sound like it)

Our algorithm matches both of these tracks and provides you the mastered **TARGET** track with the same [RMS], [FR], [peak amplitude] and [stereo width] as the **REFERENCE** track has.

🔥 **[Benn Jordan Matchering review][BennVideo]**:
> - ***Matchering 2.0 beating all other AI's**! (note: by carefully selecting a proper song as reference)*
> - *Ranking it no.3 (out of 12) right behind 2 professional master engineers*
> - *Seems a rock-solid study with 472 judged entries*
> 
> *(Thanks to [@bascurtiz](https://github.com/bascurtiz) for [the find](https://github.com/sergree/matchering/issues/59))*

You can try out **Matchering** yourself without having to install it, thanks to the hosting provided by **[Songmastr](https://www.songmastr.com/)** and **[Moises](https://moises.ai/)**.

Watch **[the video][Video]**:

So **Matchering 2.0** will make your song sound the way you want! It opens up a wide range of opportunities:
- You can make your music instantly sound like your favorite artist's music
- You can make all the tracks on your new album sound the same very quickly
- You can find new aspects of your sound in experiments
- You can do everything as you want! Because of **[Your References, Your Rules.™](https://macprovideo.com/article/audio-software/sound-tools-instant-online-mastering-with-reference-matching-now-in-open-beta)** *(just a little nostalgic note)* 🤭

> Differences from the previous major version:
> - Completely rewritten in [Python 3], based on open source tech stack (no more [MATLAB])
> - Our own open source [Hyrax] [brickwall limiter] was implemented for it
> - Processing speed and accuracy have been increased
> - Now it is [the library][PyPI] that can be connected to **everything** in **the Python world**

# Installation and Usage

If you are a music producer or an audio engineer, choose the **[Desktop App](#desktop-app---the-easiest-way)** or **[ComfyUI Node](#comfyui-node)**. 

If you are an AI mastering startup, choose the **[Docker Image](#docker-image)**. 

If you are a developer, choose the **[Python Library](#python-library---for-developers)**.

# Desktop App - The Easiest Way

### [NEW! Matchering @ UVR5 Desktop App](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/)
You can find Matchering under `Choose Process Method > Audio Tools & Choose Audio Tool > Matchering`.

### [Or try WITHOUT Installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw0nH6QqAck)

# ComfyUI Node

### [ComfyUI-Matchering](https://github.com/MuziekMagie/ComfyUI-Matchering)

# Docker Image

### [Windows](https://github.com/sergree/matchering/blob/master/DOCKER_WINDOWS.md)
### [macOS](https://github.com/sergree/matchering/blob/master/DOCKER_MACOS.md)
### [Linux](https://github.com/sergree/matchering/blob/master/DOCKER_LINUX.md)

## Updating

If you need to update the version of the installed **Docker Image**, follow **[these instructions](https://github.com/sergree/matchering/blob/master/DOCKER_UPDATING.md)**.

# Python Library - For Developers

## Installation

**4 GB RAM machine with [Python 3.8.0 or higher][Python 3] is required**

### libsndfile

**Matchering 2.0** depends on the **[SoundFile]** library, which depends on the system library **[libsndfile]**. On Windows and macOS, it installs automatically. On Linux, you need to install **[libsndfile]** using your distribution's package manager, for example:

```sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install libsndfile1```

### python3-pip

On some Linux distributions, **python3-pip** is not installed by default. For example use this command on Ubuntu Linux to fix this:

```sudo apt -y install python3-pip```

### Matchering Python Package

Finally, install our `matchering` package:

```
# Linux / macOS
python3 -m pip install -U matchering

# Windows
python -m pip install -U matchering
```

### *(Optional) FFmpeg*

If you would like to enable *MP3 loading support*, you need to install the **[FFmpeg][FFmpeg]** library. For example use this command on Ubuntu Linux:

```sudo apt -y install ffmpeg```

Or follow these instructions: [Windows][FFmpeg-win], [macOS][FFmpeg-mac].

## Quick Example

```python
import matchering as mg

# Sending all log messages to the default print function
# Just delete the following line to work silently
mg.log(print)

mg.process(
    # The track you want to master
    target="my_song.wav",
    # Some "wet" reference track
    reference="some_popular_song.wav",
    # Where and how to save your results
    results=[
        mg.pcm16("my_song_master_16bit.wav"),
        mg.pcm24("my_song_master_24bit.wav"),
    ],
)

```

You can find more examples in the **[examples directory]**.

### Or you can use premade **Matchering 2.0 Command Line Application**: **[matchering-cli]**.
### Or its enhanced fork: **[kubinka0505/matchering-cli]**.
